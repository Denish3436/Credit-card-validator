# Credit Card Validator

 I create a project in which we can validat credit card numbers using the **Luhn Algorithm**. It includes both a backend written in **Go ** and a basic frontend built with HTML and JavaScript.
### Tech Stack

- **Go**: Backend API logic and implementation of Luhn Algorithm.
- **HTML/JavaScript**: Frontend UI for interacting with the API.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the frontend.
- **HTTP Server**: Serving the frontend and handling API requests on port 8080.

### Setup and Run the Project

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo link>

cd Credit-card-validator

go run main.go luhn.go
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should see a simple form asking you to enter a credit card number.
